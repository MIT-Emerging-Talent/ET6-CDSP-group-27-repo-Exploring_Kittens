## Research Question Table

### Research Question 1 (Alona)

**Research Question:**  
How are the frequency and size of wildfires in North America related  
to health problems caused by air pollution?

**Research Novelty:**  
Not really new  
<https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3492003/>  
<https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2828029>

**Expected Data Availability:**  
Quite available

**Problems:**  
Although there is a lot of data, the topic is not really new and  
doesn't seem very promising

**Sources or Brief Explanation:**  
Studies on PM2.5 in the US

### Research Question 2 (Alona)

**Research Question:**  
How are income level and the source of antibiotic prescriptions  
related in Ukraine?

**Research Novelty:**  
Seems to be quite new  
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0196655316310896>  
<https://academic.oup.com/jacamr/article/6/2/dlae041/7633112?login=false>

**Expected Data Availability:**  
We might get some data from government statistics or surveys,  
but haven't checked yet

**Problems:**  
Prescription and purchase data may be incomplete or unofficial

**Sources or Brief Explanation:**  
WHO and UNICEF reports

### Research Question 3 (Alona)

**Research Question:**  
How does the intensity of shelling in residential areas of Ukraine  
affect access to and quality of online education?

**Research Novelty:**  
Very high

**Expected Data Availability:**  
Damage data:  
[ACLED report on Russian targeting in Ukraine](https://acleddata.com/2025/02/21/bombing-into-submission-russian-targeting-of-civilians-and-infrastructure-in-ukraine/)

Education data: Kolibri, Coursera for Refugees, UNICEF

**Problems:**  
Educational data is tricky to get. We should ask some big platforms  
and wait a long time. They don’t usually specify regions in Ukraine.

**Sources or Brief Explanation:**  
UNICEF and UN reports

### Research Question 4 (Alona)

**Research Question:**  
How does the availability of a well-developed public transportation  
system influence processed food consumption in car-free households in Canada?

**Research Novelty:**  
High – haven’t found an exact match in literature

**Expected Data Availability:**  
Not sure

**Problems:**  
Very area-specific. Requires filtering by income level, car ownership,  
and food type

**Sources or Brief Explanation:**  
_(Not specified)_

### Research Question 5 (Alona)

**Research Question:**  
How does non-prescription antibiotic use affect the spread of  
antibiotic-resistant infections in Ukraine?

**Research Novelty:**  
Haven’t seen studies on this for Ukraine

**Expected Data Availability:**  
Some lab data from universities or public health sources.  
Survey/pharmacy data limited

**Problems:**  
Black market access to antibiotics; unclear where we can  
get microbiological data

**Sources or Brief Explanation:**  
WHO AMR reports

### Research Question 6 (Zaid)

**Research Question:**  
How effective is Satellite Image Analysis at Predicting Deforestation in Malaysia?

**Research Novelty:**  
High – not much research on this topic in Malaysia.
Overall, satellite image analysis is very well-studied, but in the context
of Predicting deforestation, we could only find very few papers.
When it comes to predicting deforestation in Malaysia, we found no papers.

**Expected Data Availability:**  
Highly available.
Sattelite images are available from many sources, and we are using the
google earth engine to access them.
The vegetation index data is also available from Global Forest Watch.
Other data such as deforestation rates and forest cover are easily
accessible from government and environmental organizations.

**Problems:**  
Satellite image analysis can be computationally intensive.
Satellite images are HUGE. They requires lots of storage and time to work with.

**Sources or Brief Explanation:**  

- [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/)
- [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)
- We hope to use the vegetation index and satellite images to train a model
  that can predict deforestation in Malaysia.
