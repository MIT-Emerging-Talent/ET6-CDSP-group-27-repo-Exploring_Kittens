# Satellite Imaging

- The vastness of global forests poses a challenge for monitoring on the ground.
- satellite technology offer a comprehensive, timely, and efficient means
to keep tabs forest cover changes.
- There are several types of satellite sensors that are used for detecting deforestation:

1. **Optical sensors:**  
These capture images in visible light, much
like a standard camera, but can also detect
non-visible wavelengths, enabling them to
monitor vegetation health and moisture content.
2. **Radar sensors:**  
Using radio waves, radar sensors can penetrate clouds and even capture data at
night. They're particularly useful in regions with frequent cloud cover or in
assessing structural characteristics of forests.
3. **Thermal sensors:**  
Detecting radiation in the infrared spectrum, these sensors are instrumental in
identifying forest fires and areas of heat stress in forests.

- **Time-series data:**  
Sequences of images over time facilitates tracking of gradual changes in forest cover
and helps distinguish between temporary shifts (like seasonal changes) and
permanent ones (such as deforestation).

## Techniques and Analysis

1. **Spectral analysis:**  
Examining the different wavelengths of satellite sensors to identify specific
materials on the ground. For example, healthy vegetation reflects light
differently from stressed or dead vegetation. By analyzing these spectral
signatures, scientists can assess forest health and detect early signs of degradation.

2. **Machine learning and AI :**  
Algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns associated with deforestation,
such as the layout of roads leading to logging areas or the distinctive shapes of
clear-cuts.

3. **Data fusion:**  
integrating satellite imagery with ground-based observations.
