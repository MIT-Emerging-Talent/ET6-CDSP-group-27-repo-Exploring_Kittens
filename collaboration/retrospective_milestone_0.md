# Retrospective milestone 0

## Stop Doing

- Letting tasks and discussions remain informal without proper
  documentation on the project board.
- Wasting time revisiting issues that could have been
  prevented through more structured workflows.
- Not planning the milestone steps in detail at the beginning,
  which leads to confusion mid-way.
- Staying silent about availability or progress on assigned tasks,
  which creates uncertainty for the rest of the team.

## Continue Doing

- Maintaining clear and effective communication via the WhatsApp group.
- Holding productive group and one-on-one meetings through Google Meet.
- Actively sharing knowledge and resources to minimize
  information gaps within the team.

## Start Doing

- Encouraging full participation from all members in both
  discussions and task execution.
- Scheduling regular review sessions to stay aligned with project goals.
- Planning milestones and necessary steps earlier, to avoid rushed.
- Having short daily check-ins (written, not meetings) to update each other
  on progress and blockers.

## Lessons Learned

- Strong and consistent group communication is crucial to project success.
- Clearly defined roles and responsibilities lead to better accountability.
- Completing tasks ahead of deadlines allows time for reviews,
  feedback, and revisions.
- Retrospectives can be used to break down complex challenges,
  giving everyone the opportunity to contribute, learn,
  and gain confidence in solving similar problems in the future.
- Time zone differences are challenging, but with patience and structure,
  they can be managed effectively.

  Meetings, worked well for collaboration.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Some group members did not respond, which caused delays
  and negatively affected collaboration.
