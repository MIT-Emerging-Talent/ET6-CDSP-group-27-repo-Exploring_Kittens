# Retrospective Milestone 2

## Stop Doing

- Discussing important topics in WhatsApp instead of using structured  
  platforms.
- Starting a milestone without a clear and detailed work plan.

## Continue Doing

- Actively collaborating within the team.
- Staying open to new ideas and discussing them collectively.
- Distributing tasks fairly and completing them on time.

## Start Doing

- Making better use of the GitHub project board for tracking progress  
  and responsibilities.
- Documenting key decisions and discussions in issues or the project wiki.

## Lessons Learned

- Early brainstorming sessions helped us identify knowledge gaps and  
  adjust our research focus in time.
- Clear task ownership reduces confusion and prevents duplication of work.
- Regular check-ins, even short ones, help maintain momentum and keep  
  everyone aligned.
- Writing things down — such as decisions, questions, and progress updates —  
  improves accountability and makes it easier to onboard less active members.
- Too much flexibility in the beginning leads to delays; it’s better to  
  define roles and timelines early on.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- _(To be completed)_

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- We identified a strong research question supported by a rich dataset,  
  but decided to change it at the last minute.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Team engagement levels varied. Some members missed live meetings and  
  didn’t catch up by watching the recordings, which slowed down overall  
  progress.

## Individual Retrospectives

### Alona

- Analyzed sample research questions and actively contributed to  
  discussions around teammates' ideas.
- Helped improve and refine the work of other team members.
- Next time, will focus more on the project during critical periods and  
  stay more mindful of deadlines.
