## Content of each meeting

### June 6th, 2 PM

- How to define a question  
  - Be very specific  
  - Expect your question to change while doing more research  
- Domain of interest of group members  
- Choosing the right research question  
  - Keep availability of data in mind  
- Ideas to use image analysis  
  - Explored applying image analysis in research domains like:  
    - Deforestation  
    - Biology  
    - Healthcare  
- Consider difficulty of research question when proposing  
  - Too easy > Too difficult  
- Elaborate on image analysis

**_What to prepare for the next meeting?_**  

- On Wednesday, come to the meeting with one or more research questions
- Investigate whether image analysis is feasible or too difficult

### June 11th, 5PM EST

#### Key Discussion Points

##### Proposed Research Questions

1. How can online access to education support learning continuity during
pandemics and humanitarian crises such as refugee displacement?
2. What is the impact of wildfire exposure on respiratory health in  Canada,
 and how can it be quantified?
3. To what extent can the use of antidepressants and economic indicators in
small economies reflect the overall happiness and mental well-being of a population?
4. Can natural language processing (NLP) techniques be used to classify judicial
decisions as punitive or restorative based on the language in court judgments?
5. How effective is image analysis in detecting early signs of deforestation as
an indicator of climate change?
   - Use vegetation index to train model.
   - Many free images over several years are available online (1984–today).
   - Recommended dataset: Global Forest Watch (2000–present).
   - Consider region-bound analysis.
   - Optionally incorporate air quality data from WorldAQ (e.g., CO₂ spikes as indicators).

##### Platform Migration

It was agreed that all ongoing chats and discussions will move to _Slack_ to
ensure better tracking and visibility for the MIT team.

##### Next Steps

- A follow-up meeting is scheduled for tomorrow to finalize the research topic.
- _Asia_ suggested that each member brings at least one research topic idea
to the next meeting.
- The group will then brainstorm collectively to narrow the suggestions down to
a concise, group-approved research focus.

### June 15th, 5PM EST

#### Review of Identified Group Research Topic

- Final confirmation of the selected research topic; "How effective is Satellite
Image Analysis at Predicting Deforestation in Malaysia?"
- Clarification of objectives and scope  

#### Distributed Group Work

- Task allocation and responsibilities  
- Timeline and milestones leading up to **June 16** deadline  

#### Planning for the Next Meeting

- Agreed on next meeting date, June 16th, 2025.

#### Collaboration Folder Setup

- All members are encouraged to complete their tasks in the collaborations
folder as soon as possible.

### June 20th, 2025

#### Meeting Summary

**Context:** This meeting took place shortly after the start of Milestone 2 data
 collection on June 17th.
**Participants:** Asia, Zaid, Vahab. A recording has been shared with the rest of
 the team.

#### Agenda

- Planning the milestone and going over key deliverables.

#### Discussion Highlights

- We went through the list of deliverables for this milestone.
- As a group, we agreed to focus on what’s the most important and possibly most
  challenging deliverable:  
  _“A non-technical explanation of how you chose to model your domain, and
   possible flaws in this approach, in your README (visuals can be very helpful!).”_
- Evan asked for a bit more clarity around our research question—specifically,
  which satellite we're focusing on and what kind of deforestation we plan to study.
- We talked about the need for improving our understanding of our research
  domain and creating a plan to model our data.
- To do that, we’ll need to build a better understanding of the domain.
  Some key questions to start with:  
  - What is the definition of deforestation?  
  - What are the different causes of deforestation?  
  - What kinds of data or indicators do we need to track it?  
  - _[Feel free to add any other helpful questions that can help with domain modeling.]_

#### Steps to take

- Aim to finish this part of the deliverable by **Monday, June 23rd**, to allow
  time for an expert session with ET if needed.
- The team would appreciate short daily check-ins to help stay on track and
  avoid a last-minute rush.

### Meeting Agenda

#### 1. Topic Change Discussion

The group agreed to adopt a new research topic proposed by Vahab:  
**"Prescribed Fire Planning to Prevent Wildfires in Canada using Satellite
Images."**  _(Thunderstorms are the biggest reason for wildfires in North America.)_

#### 2. Key Concerns and Considerations

- The group acknowledged the importance of clearly defining the scope
and ensuring the topic has real-world relevance.  
- Alona pointed out that the new topic lacks a strong **social impact**
compared to those discussed in lecture slides.  
- She also noted the absence of an “**x maps to y**” correlation present in
previous topics.  
- The group emphasized the need for **concise data collection**.  
- There was consensus to **limit the geographical scope to Canada** (for now)
to keep the project focused and manageable.

#### 3. Refining the Research Question

Proposed refined versions of the research question:

- _How does the integration of satellite imagery improve the outcomes of
prescribed burning programs in mitigating wildfire risk in Canada?_
- _How effective are prescribed forest fires by satellite images in reducing
the risk of out-of-control wildfires in Canada?_

#### 4. Immediate Action Items

- The new topic will be discussed with **Evan on Slack** to confirm
its acceptability.  
- **Asia** identified similar research projects and GitHub repositories for
insight and inspiration.  
- Ongoing discussion around the **specific data types** needed for the project.

#### 5. Task Assignments

- **Vahab** will refine the group README and submit a pull
request with the updated content.  
- **Alona** will create a format for group member retrospectives
and begin coordinating task assignments for upcoming deadlines.

## 6. Next Meeting

- **Date:** June 29, 2025  
- **Time:** 1:00 PM EST  
- **Agenda:** Team members will report on progress and discuss feedback from Evan.
